## Collaboration Guidelines

We are a 3-person team working in parallel on different parts of the project.
To keep everything organized and avoid conflicts:

### Branch Workflow

* `main` â†’ stable, reviewed work only
* `dev` â†’ staging branch for merging team contributions
* Each member creates their own feature branch:

  * `leslie-viz/` for figures and maps
  * `felix-analysis/` for cleaning and analysis
  * `manuel-report/` for documentation and writing

### Workflow Steps

1. **Pull latest changes** before starting work:

   ```bash
   git pull origin dev
   ```
2. **Create a new branch** for your task:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
   ```
3. **Commit frequently** with clear messages:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Cleaned ACS data and added tract join"
   ```
4. **Push and open a Pull Request (PR)** to `dev`:

   ```bash
   git push origin <your-branch-name>
   ```
5. **Review Pull Requests** from teammates before merging.
